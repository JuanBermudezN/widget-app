This a React based Widget App with it's own custom router, it has an Accordion, a Dropdown, a Searchbar that uses the Wikipedia API, and a basic tranlastor that consumes the Google Translate API.

I deployed the app to AWS Elasticbeanstalk through github actions, anytime a new commit on the Main branch is detected it will run a new deployment.
